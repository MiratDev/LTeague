# Squarespace Template Guide

A simple, sortable table to compare basic features between various [Squarespace templates](http://www.squarespace.com/templates/).
This guide is built on [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) and is hosted on Github Pages at [squarespaceguide.agilestyle.com](http://squarespaceguide.agilestyle.com/)
We've put it up on github so you can contribute in any way you see fit. (Typically, this will be with content additions/revisions, as Squarespace adds, removes, and/or changes template features)

This little app was inspired by Miko Coffey's [Squarespace 6 Template Comparison Chart.](http://www.usingmyhead.com/squarespace-6-template-comparison-chart/) Once we started working on Squarespace 7 and learned there was unfortunately no other resource for the many new changes brought in by Squarespace 7.
